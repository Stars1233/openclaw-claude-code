# Reference trace format

Each `.jsonl` file contains a sequence of trace entries. The replayer
(`src/__tests__/ultraapp/trace-replayer.ts`) walks them in order: pre-loads
the canned Claude replies into a stubbed `SessionManager`, then drives user
actions (answers / file ingestion) into the real `UltraappManager`. The
resulting on-disk `spec.json` is compared against the matching
`expected/<name>.appspec.json` snapshot.

## Entry shapes

```jsonc
// Simulates Claude's reply for the next interview turn (pre-loaded into
// the stubbed sendMessage queue).
{ "kind": "claude-question", "envelope": <QuestionEnvelope> }

// Simulates Claude calling a runtime tool. The replayer pre-loads the
// reply containing the <tool> XML; the real tool runner executes against
// the test store. For tools that need a stubbed result (extract_metadata),
// embed `result` and the runner mock returns that value.
{ "kind": "claude-tool", "tool": "update_spec", "args": [...] }
{ "kind": "claude-tool", "tool": "extract_metadata", "args": {...}, "result": {...} }
{ "kind": "claude-tool", "tool": "check_completeness", "result": {"ok": true, "missing": []} }

// Simulates Claude emitting [INTERVIEW: COMPLETE].
{ "kind": "claude-complete", "summary": "..." }

// Simulates a user submitting an answer to the previous question.
{ "kind": "user-answer", "value": "<chosen option value>", "freeform": "<text>"? }

// Simulates a user uploading or referencing a file.
{ "kind": "user-file", "filename": "<name>", "contents-b64": "<...>" }
{ "kind": "user-path", "absolutePath": "<path>" }
```

## Authoring a new trace

1. Run a real interview through the dashboard (Forge tab → + New).
2. Copy each Claude reply (the question envelope) and each user action into
   the JSONL file in order. For `update_spec` tool calls, copy the JSON
   patch operations into `args`.
3. After the interview ends, copy the final `~/.claw-orchestrator/ultraapps/<runId>/spec.json`
   into `expected/<trace-name>.appspec.json`.
4. Add the trace name to the `TRACES` array in
   `src/__tests__/ultraapp/spec-extraction-quality.test.ts`.

## Status of bundled traces

All 5 reference traces from the v1.0 plan ship and replay successfully
against their frozen AppSpec snapshots:

- **text-summariser** — synthetic / hand-crafted (1 input, 1 step, 1 output).
- **image-batch-resize** — captured against real Claude Opus
  (4 inputs, 1 output, 3 steps).
- **vlog-cut** — captured (2 inputs, 1 output, 4 steps).
- **llm-agent-pipeline** — captured (2 inputs, 1 output, 3 steps).
- **branching-dag** — captured (2 inputs, 2 outputs, 3 steps; true DAG with
  parallel branches that converge).

To author a new trace, set `UA_DEBUG_TURNS=<dir>` on the server, drive an
interview to completion, and the script in this directory's git history
shows the reconstruction recipe (parse turn outputs → claude-* + user-*
JSONL entries; final on-disk `spec.json` becomes the expected snapshot).
